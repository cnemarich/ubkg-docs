# Ingest Validation Tools & Upload Guidelines

Well-defined schemas ensure that SenNet data and metadata are reusable. 
If you are starting work on a new assay type, review the guidelines for directory schemas. 
If you have an upload prepared, it can be validated with [validate_upload.py](https://github.com/sennetconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/blob/main/src/validate_upload.py), or if you only have an individual TSV, use [validate_tsv.py](https://github.com/sennetconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/blob/main/src/validate_tsv.py). 
Examples of both good and bad uploads, and the validation messages they produce, are available.
